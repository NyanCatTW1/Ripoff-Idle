# Ripoff-Idle

Once upon a time I was trying to come up with an idea for an idle game that wasn't just a ripoff of another idle game, so I decided to ripoff not one, but as many idle games as possible, all in one game. So that is what I'm doing.

It starts off like Cookie Clicker, you click the cookie to get cookies. You spend the cookies on buildings, like cursors and grandmas. This is where Antimatter Dimensions comes in, you not only have one kind of cursor but 8 different dimensional cursors, if you've played AD you know how this works. You buy upgrades and earn achievements and not much else yet.
